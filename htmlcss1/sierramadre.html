        I went hiking today with my best friend Marianne in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Madre_Mountains_(California)"
        >Sierra Madre Mountains</a>. It was a <em>gorgeous</em> 
        day. I thought of 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir">John Muir</a>
        and this quote as I was hiking:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Keep close to Nature's heart... and break <em>clear</em> 
        away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. 
        Wash your spirit clean.
