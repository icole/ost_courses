	<p>
        Keeping up with the latest trends and practicies in Web Technologies takes work. One way in which I enjoy doing that is by reading books. Here is a list of some of my favorities.
	</p>
        <table id="books">
            <tr>
                <td><img src="http://colecoding.com/images/rspec-book.jpg" alt=""></td>
                <td>Good introduction to Test Driven Development. Using Cucumber and RSpec this book is a great primer to good TDD practicies. One of the first books I would recommend to any aspiring Ruby on Rails engineer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="http://colecoding.com/images/clean_coder.jpg" alt=""></td>
                <td>This book really helps seperate a good developer from a great one. Robert Martin does a spectacular job of explaining professional coding practicies in a fun writing style that uses many of his own seuccess and failures as examples.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="http://colecoding.com/images/ood_ruby.jpg" alt=""></td>
                <td>Good design practicies can make applications a pleasure to work with in the long run, and prevent the headache of adding new features that some apps have. This particular book really helped bring together the principles of good design I learned in my degree and the ease of development with Ruby.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
